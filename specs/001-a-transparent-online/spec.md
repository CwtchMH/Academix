## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

**Exam Taking Flow**: A student discovers an exam code, registers for the exam, undergoes identity verification through facial recognition, takes the exam under AI-powered monitoring for cheating prevention, submits answers for automatic grading, and receives results with a blockchain-verified certificate if successful.

**Certificate Verification Flow**: A third-party verifier (employer, institution) receives a certificate claim from a student, scans a QR code or enters certificate details, and instantly verifies the authenticity and validity through blockchain records.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a student has valid credentials and an exam code, **When** they register for an exam, **Then** they must complete face verification before accessing exam questions
2. **Given** a student is taking an exam, **When** suspicious behavior is detected by AI monitoring, **Then** alerts are logged and the student may be flagged for review
3. **Given** a student completes an exam with passing grade, **When** results are processed, **Then** a blockchain certificate is automatically issued with unique verification hash
4. **Given** a teacher wants to create questions, **When** they upload course material, **Then** AI can suggest questions which the teacher can review and approve before publishing
5. **Given** a verifier has certificate details, **When** they access the public verification endpoint, **Then** they receive authentic certificate information without accessing personal student data

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a student's internet connection drops during an exam?
- How does the system handle attempted impersonation during face verification?
- What occurs if blockchain transaction fails during certificate issuance?
- How are partial exam submissions handled if time expires?
- What safeguards exist if AI proctoring gives false positive cheating alerts?
